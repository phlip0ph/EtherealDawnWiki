====== Mundus ======
Created Wednesday 24 March 2021

The mainland, Mundus, which you will be traveling from, was always varied. The plains, forests, mountains, jungles, and tropical coasts were always there, but now the places and their people have become something more. All of the races are spread throughout the lands, though there are concentrations where races and those of certain vocations are better adapted to survive or practice their craft. There is no central power, such things fell out of practice long ago. The villages, towns, and cities govern themselves, interacting with each other as need be. Generally there is peace, though conflicts arise here and there from time to time for various reasons. The land is separated into four main regions:

===== • [[Mundus:Terris|Terris]] =====

===== • [[Mundus:Veridant|Veridant]] =====

===== • [[Mundus:Selva|Selva]] =====

===== • [[Mundus:Inselberg|Inselberg]] =====
