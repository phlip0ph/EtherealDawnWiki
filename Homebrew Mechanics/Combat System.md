# Combat System
## Problems being solved
Current combat is too lengthy and annoying. We want combat to be quick, snappy and fun without getting bogged down in numbers and such.

## System 1 : Notches
### Health
Instead of the typical hitpoints you have a significantly less number of "notches" (might be level + 1 hit die max?)
Being hit deals a certain number of dice depending on the power of the creature and the attack used.
Notches can be regenerated in steps of notches.
Resistances and Weaknesses double and halve damage as usual

### Damage

## System 2 : Skill Challenge / Cinematic
