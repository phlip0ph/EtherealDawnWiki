# Angband

## The Premise
Crime on Troika for the most part is something that's handled independently by each settlement, city, and culture. The people below The Knives of God have their own jails and prisons (or at least had them before their fall), the ones above have their traditions of trials, exile, and execution. Goreane operates in it's own lawless and anarchal way. Encephelon has it's own "prison" of magical stasis and crystallization. However, there is one pillar of punishment that is shared across the land. Angband, The Iron Fortress.

Buried in the center of a volcano, at the heart of The Black Brume Mountains, lies an iron fortress turned prison. It is one of the few standing and "accessible" monuments of the ancient civilization, and of all that is known it is also the most terrible. It needs no guards, no order, no security, and no further punishment within or without than that which it itself provides. Even to escape for most means only that your lungs will be turned to ash upon breathing in the heated air outside, quickly followed by the rest of your body.
The few who have entered and managed to return have come out broken, speaking of labyrinthian halls, unimaginable horrors of creatures and other broken peoples, and repeated, unending, ever torturous death. The feeling of one's soul leaving their body, only to be viciously ripped apart by an unknown force, crudely patchworked back together, and to awaken somewhere within the structure, changed yet the same. The experience so common and traumatic they've come to know it better than the beating of their own hearts. No one knows the force that causes this, nor does anyone have the desire to find out.

Peoples all over Troika transport their most vile, violent, and irredeemable villains to Angband to be forever forgotten. Others use it to commit evil themselves, threatening those they wish to control with imprisonment and unending torture within.

Unfortunately you find yourself here, whether due to deserved punishment or unfortunate circumstance, it matters not because you are arriving in a living hell all the same.

## Episode Vibes
### Character Creation
We'll be using the Chimera System for this episode
Come up with a reason why your character is being imprisoned, some good examples are:
- Being closely associated with a BBEG somewhere
- Being imprisoned by someone or some group who wants to torture you or take you out of the picture without explicitly killing you
- Being an overconfident adventurer who thinks they can take on the fortress and uncover it's secrets
- Teleportation gone wrong (lmao)
- Being framed for a terrible crime

Given the circumstances of the episode and location, any alignment is fine but as always try to have a reason to generally get along with other party members. Also, don't do something lazy like "my character is just a serial rapist", get some actual character depth going so that the sanity mechanic we're going to be implementing can be actually useful.

We'll discuss what you get in terms of items and such during our session 0.
Also feel free to come to me with a homebrew class and feats and we'll find a way to work it into the system.

### Combat & Death
As you can guess this episode is going to be featuring you dying, probably a lot. We can discuss exactly how this is going to work but my current ideas are:
- Everytime you die, keep the same character, lose some number of your items and skills, and reroll stats
- Everytime you die, roll a completely new character
- Everytime you die, keep the same character, lose items and skills, reduce stats instead of reroll (this would work if all player chars were BBEGs)

There will also be a heavier focus on combat and dungeon crawling instead of roleplay compared to previous ED episodes so that we can better flesh out the system, but roleplay will still be relevant and there will still be progress towards uncovering the secrets of Troika and it's past, same as always.

**Things will be brutal and unfair.** There will be bullshit traps, enemies, items, etc. I want the experience of playing in this episode equivalent to playing an oldschool roguelike, expect as much. On top of the experience being fucking tight, it'll also help with balancing out the Chimera system.

### Some General Lore
Here's some general lore to help with character creation and such.
- Angband is only well known within the heavily populated areas of Troika (Encephelon City, Knives of God specifically the dwarven cities, Goreane), and even then, it is generally seen or thought of as a place of story and legend, especially among younger generations and less densely populated areas who have not had the experience of a BBEG or similar.
- People outside Troika are almost completely unaware of Angband, those few who are only know of it through story as well, even fewer know of the actual existence of the place.
