# The Search for Dawn 
Created Wednesday 07 April 2021

## Session 1 

## Premise 
It has been a little over a year since the rediscovery of Troika, after 1000 years of stories, finally the knowledge of magic and science were advanced enough to attempt the voyage.
Of the 3 ships that launched from the coast of Terris that day - The Cetus, Smythe, and Zaratan - only 1 was able to make it across the ocean that had been filled with vicious and gargantuan creatures.
The Cetus, with it's balance of nature, science, and magic, was able to avoid the dangerous gaze of the creatures below, and barely able to scrape by those that roamed above, supposedly thanks to a group of passengers that were aboard. The latter creatures, however, resulted in the ship not being able to make a return trip.
Several months after that voyage, when most of Troika became aware to the presence of foreigners in it's land, Linia Stirwell renowned alchemist and arcanist, was able to perform the first known transcontinental blind teleportation, guided by information given by some of the surviving crew and passengers.
After that legendary event teleportation circles were set up in Mundus, connected to sibling circles along the Broken Coast of Troika. Now it is somewhat common for people to travel between the continents that were for so long estranged, that is assuming you have the funds to pay Linia or are willing to risk an "illegal" teleporation.
Since then many Mundians have been settling along the coasts of Troika, mainly the Broken Coast and Knives of God, though few have made the journey all the way Preta Swamp (the area containing [[Encephelon City]]), after discovering quickly that the innerland was practically uninhabitable to most of them.
The ease of travel has unlocked a new golden age of magic and technology on both continents, with Troika trading its advanced magical secrets and Mundus its advanced technological ones, and of course the search for the cause of the Ethereal Dawn is more vigorous than ever.


4 Months after [[The Great Transcontinental Teleportation]], The_Great_Transcontinental_Teleportation.md , as it is now known, you all sit, amidst this fantastical time, in a bar, The Bone Flea Bar, to be specific. A tiny and shitty hovel carved into a wall of the "pinky" of the gargantuan creature turned underground complex called Goreane. You have been led here out of wanderlust, curiousity, a quest, or exile. Whatever it may be, as if the strings of fate themselves are pulling upon you, you all look up from your doings at the same time, making eye contact.
Can everyone please describe their characters.

### Potential Events 
Leads on the flower
* Alatar - though he has been even more closed off than usual lately
* Khrackle - the other cryselian, a researcher of the ethereal dawn before being sent to the black brume mountains for inhumane experimentation
* Someone in [[Encephelon City]] might know more, plenty of collectors there (Lulden - tortle, Amodi - Silver Dragon disguised as human, Linia, and potentially The Lord Equinox)

Mythic Dawn presence in Goreane
* Are setup near the head of Goreane, not inside it but beyond the warnings and portions that are sealed off.
* Perception check of 15 to notice small symbols of the sun rising, of Dawn
	* Man with a tattoo of it in the Bone Flea, can follow him or find the symbols to be led to a dead end that is a warning of Dimensional Flux but is actually illusory. Going into it you are just turned around, going into a fog and suddenly coming back to where you were. DC 18 intelligence check to see through the illusion, DC 15 Arcana to figure out the way to "unlock" the illusion, or dispel magic spell will work.

### Actual Events 
Bartender of the bone flea is a member of the mythic dawn
Most members are deformed, relatively large number in Goreane
Simon's Underground - The HoneyDew Special
Everyone drinks/parties/passes out
Alley way meeting
Decide to travel together
Harass drug dealer
Buys [[Crack]]
Threaten drug dealer who pulls a gun

## Session 2 
### Premise

### Potential Events 
[[The Middle#Radii Tavern| Radii Tavern]] - encounter Matt's char

### Actual Events 
See collapsed buildings from sand kings and other burrowers
Go to Radii Tavern, joined by Gannon
Assassination attempt by Des drow Arcane Assassin, hired by the MYthic Dawn out of fear
Restrain Des and hire him to sleuth the mythic dawn
Go to handle the job that the group overheard given to Gannon by the tavern keep, going back to the burrow through the building
Fight 2 sand kings and then a Gibbering Abomination
Divya attempts to communicate with it multiple times, failing to get through to a single consciousness
It disappears in an implosion, leaving behind only pieces not attached to it.
The party goes on their way back to the Radii Tavern

## Session 3
After "taking care of" the Gibbering Abomination (It actually seemed to teleport away, seemingly imploding and disappearing within itself), the party has yet more questions about the land of Troika. Last left off, the party is on it's way back to Radii Tavern to report it's success. Ultimately the party wants to head to the thumb to conclude it's investigation on the Mythic Dawn sect in this area. They want to know what is known about Makima and why they were after him, as well as what their goal is.

### Potential Events
- Getting paid for the job - The party will most likely ask for payment from the bartender, Sev. He will redirect them to the [[The Index#Encephelon Guard Station | Encephelon Guard Station]]  in The Index, giving them a written note with a seal as proof of job completion.
