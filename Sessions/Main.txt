===== Session 14 - Main Cast Farewell =====

==== Premise ====
The main players want to take a break from their current characters.

The idea is that the main cast will be pausing their quest to go look for Odd who disappeared before their eyes, wiped from their existence.
Zeitres is the only one who remembers him and has been distressed since his disappearance and by the lack of memory from her companions.

==== Last Time ====
The party made it to the Badlands, an intbetween on their way to Encephelon City. They came across a vampire and bounty hunter named Wilhelm whom they helped - mainly because they were shot at - and who is going to guide them to [[Troika:The Badlands:Goreane|Goreane]].

==== Planned Events ====
Wilhem shows them an entrance into Goreane, specifically the Pinky since they're the closest to it.
	He'll be able to tell the party that Goreane connects the entire Badlands underground. Travel above ground if you're looking to kill or be killed.
	No one travels to the center (head)  of Goreane. Paths that lead there are litered with warnings or outright sealed off / caved in. People who have gone have never come back. Judging by the feeling it is some sort of dimensional rift. Most people who get close probably get pulled through, and those who wouldn't get pulled through likely have no reason to go there
The party stops by a bar, playing The Who
