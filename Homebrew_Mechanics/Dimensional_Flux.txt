====== Dimensional Flux ======
Created Wednesday 24 March 2021

Troika is known for the mysterious phenomena known as dimensional flux that is responsible for many of the oddities on the continent and is theorized to be linked to the Ethereal Dawn itself. What's for sure is that all magical races feel some draw to the continent because of it and specifically to the [[Troika:The Drift:Maphic Tower|Maphic Tower,]] the strongest known source of dimensional flux. Natives of Troika have inate resistance to this power, specifically being born further inland and closer to the Maphic Tower increases this resistance to the point of near immunity. It is not uncommon of expecting parents of the fringes to rent the services of those powerful or in possession of artifacts of power to guide them to inland to give birth.

===== Effects of Dimensional Flux =====
Those exposed to levels of Dimensional Flux that are above what they can resist are at risk of suffering various and inexplicable effects. Effects that have been recorded so far include
* Death via spontaneous combustion
* Death via spontaneous implosion
* Permanent transformation into inanimate objects
* Permanent transformation into other lifeforms
* Permanent transformation into other beings (the resulting beings often claim to have been minding their business elsewhere though no one ever knows who they are, even if they claim to be from the same area. Theorized that this event is the result of beings of similar soul signatures being switched between dimensions)
* Seeming disappearance from existence (known colloquially as Popping due to the sound often accompanied with such events)
* Death via organ failure
* Insanity and Madness
* Loss of bodily functions despite no damage (blindness, deafness, mobility, etc.)
* Death, simple death, they just keel over for seemingly no reason

===== Ways to resist Dimensional Flux =====
Besides those specifically born on Troika, there are no beings that are known to have an inate resistance to Dimensional Flux. However, due to the way that Dimensional Flux seemingly functions, there are creatures who would quickly become unsusceptable to it, due to the fact that they quickly grow to be powerful enough to be rooted in reality. For example: despite a Tarrasque never having been spotted on Troika, it is theorised that due to its sheer power, it would easily resist most of the instances of Dimensional Flux on the continent with the obvious exception of the Maphic Tower.

Essentially the key to resisting Dimensional Flux, is power. The Current running theory based on research so far and information from the locals is that Dimensional Flux is a warping of reality across its weakest points. Think of parallel dimensions as taught fabrics, evenly spaced vertically and stacked infinitely. Weak points where Dimensional Flux exists are sags and pitches in these fabrics where the fabrics of multiple dimensions touch which to someone existing in that dimension can have a multitude of effects as listed above. However, it has been observed that beings and objects of considerable power are able to subtly push and pull the fabrics of their reality into place, keeping them safe. They are still susceptible to Ethereal Glimpses though.

===== Ethereal Glimpses =====
Ethereal Glimpses are anomalies even among Dimensional Fluxes. They are essentially ripples of strong Dimensional Flux that appear to originate from the [[Troika:The Drift:Maphic Tower|Maphic Tower]] and spread with dimishing effects throughout Troika, though such events have been observed to reach Mundus at times. Being effected one of these seems to simply be a matter of luck.
