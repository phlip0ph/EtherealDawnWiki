===== The Ethereal Dawn =====
Ethereal Dawn is a Dungeons & Dragons 5E campaign that I'm running. The core premise of this campaign is that 1000 years ago magic and magical races appeared in an even known now as the Ethereal Dawn. People died, others transformed, and all were infused with some form of magic.
