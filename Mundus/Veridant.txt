====== Veridant ======
Created Wednesday 24 March 2021

Located in the south-eastern quarter of Mundus, the landscape of Veridant consists of jungles and swamps with dangerous predators. Creatures that will silently stalk you, plants that will lie in wait for living prey, and areas of land that will slowly suck you in and use you as fertilizer. The people of this region have learned to use this land to their advantage however. Settlements in Veridant are usually built among the thick canopy, stretching between trees for miles and miles. Some are built into the trees themselves, whether among the tops or under their roots. Some creatures, such as the grung, even live under the water of the deep swamps. Agile creatures that can move quickly and quietly throughout the land and across the treetops, such as Tabaxi, reside here. Though there are also those with the strength or bodies to defend themselves or hide, such as Tortles and Grung. There are also those strongly attuned to nature residing here. Those of Veridant who trade with the other regions often trade exotic fruits, plants, creatures, and woods.
