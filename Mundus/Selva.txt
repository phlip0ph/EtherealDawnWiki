====== Selva ======
Created Wednesday 24 March 2021

Bordering Veridant and Terris, Selva is the tropical coast that runs along the southern and south-western areas of Mundus. The people here are attuned to the wildlife of the sea, their villages structured out of bones of creatures hunted from the seas or washed on shore, as well as wood from the bordering regions. They also trade the parts of the creatures they hunt, the bones are strong, the flesh abundant, and many have special properties and work as alchemical ingredients. They specialize in fishing, boating, woodworking, and using the parts of creatures for various things. Every Selvan is taught from a young age through stories and warnings, not to stray too far from the coast, lest you be consumed by one of the gargantuan creatures that every Selvan has seen surfacing in the distance or washed up on the shore. Aquatic races such as triton, tortle, and some lizard folk, are common here.
