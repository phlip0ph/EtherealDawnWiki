====== Inselberg ======
Created Wednesday 24 March 2021

A cold and mountainous region, bordering northern Terris. For every high peak there is a deep crevice or ravine that seems to stretch to the bowels of the world. As such both the highest flying and most majestic creatures, and those who embody the essence of deep and dark reside here. It stretches far, far, north, and the further one goes, the more perilous the journey as dragons, giants, and such become more common and civilization less so. No one has been to the northern edge and come back, an enticing prospect for adventurers. The people who reside at the tops of the mountain are hardy beings and are usually attuned to the cold or air, or are able to fly: Dwarves, Aarakockra, Goliaths. Those who reside in the deep and eventually volcanic depths are Tieflinfs, Dwarves, and those attuned to flames or darkness. Inselberg mainly exports the minerals and ores found throughout, along with the parts of creatures such as dragons and giants. The people are also exceptional craftsmen, well versed in metal and stoneworking. It is also an ideal area for those who wish for solitude, whether to conduct research or simply escape from the world.
