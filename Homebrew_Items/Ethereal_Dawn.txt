====== Ethereal Dawn ======
Created Wednesday 07 April 2021

Not to be confused with the event, an Ethereal Dawn is a legendarily rare flower. For the few that know of the existence of such flowers and the even fewer who have supposedly seen one, it is said that an Ethereal Dawn is a flower unlike any other.
Within it is the essence of the Ethereal Dawn itself, a violent and sudden convergence of worlds, slowly being pushed together into a catastrophically beautiful singularity.
