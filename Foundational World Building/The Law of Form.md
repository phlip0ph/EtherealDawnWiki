The Law of Form makes it so that the form of an object determines it's function. It can be seen as a sort of convergence of the other laws but can be studied and observed on it's own reliably. A cut cannot be made without an edge, a bird cannot fly without its wings, running cannot be done without legs. The form of a creature or object is what determines it's function. There is room for more. The blunt side of a blade can be used to hammer, legs meant for walking can jump, but what a thing is best for and designed for is determined by it's form. This matters the most in magical applications. Casters shape the weave to create effects and some of the work can be done for them by various apparatuses and foci. If one wishes to cast a spell over a large area, they may channel their magic through a large and intricately designed plate. A spell sniper would want to cast through long and thing objects that focus the magic to a point.
