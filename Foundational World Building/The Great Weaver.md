## Background
The Great Weaver has no given name, no given purpose. She has no direct worshipers, friends, family. She simply performs her duty, though she is not even sure if it is necessary for her to continue. At first she was driven by a strange sense of duty. Now she continues out of boredom and curiosity. She wishes to see how the laws and beings that inherent her many worlds evolve and continue with their lives as they continuously pull on the strands of her web, ever so slightly influencing their existences by influencing her web.

## Abilities
Omniscience - Due to creating everything in the universe both known and unknown. She is aware of all events, thoughts, feelings etc. She has the power to control and change such things but decides not to. There are no secrets or mysteries for her.
All Powerful - Once again, due to being the source of all creation. She is able to change anything in the web she has woven, create anything she can imagine, produce any effect, etc.

## Personality
The Weaver is a calm and curious being. She has not spoken to another being ever, though if she were to encounter one from within her web she would have no problem communicating. After all she has watched and influenced the creation of all forms of communication and languages. If one were to encounter her, she would most likely inquire about their lives, though she already knows everything about it. She is relatively indifferent to all, given there is such a large amount of things she has produced, but she does feel a certain love and appreciation for all of her creations and would most likely grant them a wish if they encountered and asked one of her.

## Appearance
Her true form is similar to that of a great spider. Large enough to create a web that spans the entire multiverse. Though she can appear in many different forms depending on her will and whoever witnesses her. To another she may appear as a woman weaving on a loom, a basket weaver, a smaller spider, etc.
