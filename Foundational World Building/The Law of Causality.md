The Law of Causality is the effect of the nature of a spider's web. Touching one part of it results in vibrations throughout the entire web. The harder the force, the more it vibrates. Thus, every thought, feeling, and event that happens within [[The Weave]] affects all other parts of it in one way or another. Nothing is truly isolated on the cosmic scale and there are meanings to be drawn to any events, no matter how minuscule. Meanings of everything are intertwined at some point or another.
