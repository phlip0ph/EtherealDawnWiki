The Law of Regression is one of the primary [[Laws of The Universe]]. It states that the closer things are to their origin, the more they want to return to their origin. This manifests in many ways. For example, it is difficult to get over an addiction until the withdrawal is over with. Withdrawal is the result of the law of regression. Until a thing is closer to it's destination than its origin, they will feel a desire and be drawn towards their origin. [[Dimensional Flux]] is also the result of this law and it is why being powerful is a way to counteract it. The more powerful a being becomes, the further they are from their origins, and thus the Law of Regression pulls them towards their destination and future rather than their origin and past.
