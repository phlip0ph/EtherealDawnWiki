No one knows of any definitive "birth" of the universe. The oldest being in the universe (though she is unknown to most), [[The Great Weaver]], knows not even her own origins. She hatched from an egg and began to weave her web of creation. She does not know why she does it, why she exist, she simply continues diligently to perform her duties. Her webs defining the laws of the universe, every event, every bit of existence down to the atom and beyond.
