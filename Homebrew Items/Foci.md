# Foci
Foci take on many shapes

Do not require attunement to use as they are no inherently magical

## Blaster / Potion Sprayer
Does not require attunement as it is not inherently magical. A total of 2 potions can be loaded into the sprayer as a bonus action, and they can be sprayed as an action. If the potion heals or does damage, add an additional 1d6 to the effect. If the potion needs to be imbibed to get its effect, such as with a potion of fire breath, the sprayer works as if the potion had been imbibed. The sprayer has 2 modes, stream and spray. In stream mode, it is single target and the range is 30ft and if the effect deals damage or heals, add an addition 1d(Whatever the potion uses) to the roll. In sprayer mode, the potion effects a 15ft cone and creatures caught in it must make a (DC 14) dex save, on pass they take half the dmg and on a fail they take full.
If both of the vial slots are empty, the potion sprayer works as a Blaster Foci, a spell can loop between the 2 vial slots, storing the spell cast into it for up to 10 minutes before it dissipates. The two modes of the sprayer are still available, in stream mode, the spell, regardless of its original property, becomes single target, and allows the user to add their spell casting modifier, and gains an additional 30ft of range. In sprayer mode, the spell becomes a 15 ft cone, unless the it is already a cone spell, in which case the range increase by 10ft. Additionally in spray mode, creatures caught in the spell must make the relevant save (default dex) instead of the caster rolling to hit, against the casters spell save DC to either take half dmg/avoid the effect on a pass or take the full damage / effect on a save. Cantrips can be cast through the foci as if using a regular action and gain the benefits but 1st level spells and higher requires the relevant action to load the foci.
