# The Root System
All of the plant life of Encephelon is connected by a massive root system that spans the entirety of the region. It has grew rapidly over time when the swamps first appeared, though its growth appears to be halted by the neighboring regions. It appears as if theres regions almost appear to fight for more land, some decades one area a little bigger, another it'll be a little smaller.

The root system is accesible many ways. In theory it can be accessed via any plant, though good luck being or becoming small enough to get into one. For most sentient species, the way to go is to find an Elder Tree, large ancient trees that can span a few miles in width and can tower over the already immense trees of the swamp. The veins of their roots are at times even wide enough for large creatures to traverse, though for the most part the only beings you'll see going through them are smaller races and creatures, particularly those with an affinity for water, as the ecosystem that this labyrinth supports is still very much alive, and many an unsuspecting have been swept away by sudden floods as an Elder Tree quenches it's thirst.

## Inhabitants
### [Troglodytes ](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=troglodyte)
Have been witnessed in small tribes among the root system. Their barbaric nature typically results in them being a threat to other inhabitants and is a constant concern for any outsider venturing through.

### Ooze-choked
It seems that the swamp itself has some level of sentience to it, and it exerts this sentience but killing whatever creature that happens into it and infecting/controlling it with ooze as the ooze itself does not have enough structure or will to . There are ooze-choked creatures of all varities and races

### Gnarls
Living trees that take care of the Elder Trees and the root system. They seem to hold no intelligence of their own but carry out the will of the swamp and the root system, chasing away outsiders and tending to the root system in various ways. Cleaning, pruning, cleansing, etc. Gnarls never stop growing, when they became unable to fit through the root system that they care for they become apart of it's walls. Outsiders be wary of newly joined Gnarls as they're still very much capable of movement, serving as natural and intelligent traps.


### Noskil The Spider Queen and her children
A giant Orb Weaver that rules over the root system of encephelon. Her network of webs and children means that she knows -at least approximiately- all that is occuring across the entirety of the expansive network. She takes from and kills the inhabitants when she pleases, sacrifices only delaying the inevitable end of whatever small civilization when she sets her many eyes on them. Those who thrive among the root system have either learned to live in symbiosis with her, are irrelevant to her, or are able to hide or defend themselves.
She has many nest across the network, some of them taking up entire Elder Trees

### [Moldies](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vegepygmy)
Small creatures taking the shapes of various creatures both beast and humanoid. They're not very intelligent and tend to live in small and simplistic villages. They are not inherently hostile and cannot put up much of a fight when threatened. They rely on staying hidden for the most part and are only able to put up a real fight when they come together with shamanistic magic, usually organized by elder Moldies.
