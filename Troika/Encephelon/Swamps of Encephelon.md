# The Swamps of Encephelon
The swamps that surround Encephelon are surprisingly vile and hostile. It's truly a mystery why anyone would decide to settle here. Noxious gas and fumes constantly emit from vile pools, dangerous creatures prowl, preying on travelers and adventurers, and the swamp itself feels as if it wants to consume all who inhabit, spitting them back as creatures of ooze to help the swamp consume more. The Swamps are a slice of The Swamps of Oblivion and more importantly, The Paraelemental Plane of Ooze. The trash pit of the multiverse where all of the other planes converge.

- Large thick trees tower over the region
- Vines that cover most of the area, the bulbs that hang from them let off dim glows of various colors, though it is little comfort is it only goes to outline the shapes that creep through the darkness.
- The thick canopy far overhead seems to keep the area in a constant state of twilight regardless of the time of day (permanent dim light)
- Sunken wooden structures, abandoned tree houses
- Some stone entrances that have sunken below the mud, inaccesible for now. Have a notable arcane energies emitting from them.
- Attempts to go below the mud will result in suffocation and or poisoning
