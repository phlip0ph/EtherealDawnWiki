# Encephelon City
The "capital" city of Troika. A hub of trade, culture, and very odd people. The city is split into two sides. The west side is more logical and normal, the left side descends into borderline madness due to the effects of dimensional drifting, though its typically described as "ecentric".

Ruled by [[Gealtach Equinox]], fellow ambassador along with [[Bik Bok]] (real name tbd). Will attempt to halt the party if they try to pursue the true ruins of the city.

## Description
The outside of the city is quite the site to behold. On all sides it is surrounded by the Swamps of Encephelon but the trees that typically tower over the area are no where to be seen in a 2 mile radius of the city.

## Guards
The guards of Encephelon City are far from the typical. Encephelon city was a unique case in that it was booming from it's inception. As such, most of the people that live within the city are apart of families that have existed since the beginning, and most of them are wealthy. Most of these people had no will or saw no use to serve in some police force, this resulted in the creation of the current force. Staffed by flesh golemns created by Linia Stirwell in service of Equinox.
Their appearance is pale flesh, as if 3 days dead, They wear bands that cover their eyes, set in the center by a large vile purple, sickly green, or sickly yellow crystal, capable of anti-magic, enervation, and paralysis respectively when they fire energy beams from whatever is beneath them. When they raise the bands over their eyes a blinding light is revealed, it is unclear if the light originates from eyes or some something else, but those hit by the blue beam that originates from beneath are struck forcefully and possibly even destroyed if under constant fire. The area struck feels numbed, as if given an anestethic or struck with electricity.
