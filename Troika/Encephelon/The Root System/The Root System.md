# The Root System
All of the plant life of Encephelon is connected by a massive root system that spans the entirety of the region. It has grew rapidly over time when the swamps first appeared, though its growth appears to be halted by the neighboring regions. It appears as if theres regions almost appear to fight for more land, some decades one area a little bigger, another it'll be a little smaller.

The root system is accesible many ways. In theory it can be accessed via any plant, though good luck being or becoming small enough to get into one. For most sentient species, the way to go is to find an Elder Tree, large ancient trees that can span a few miles in width and can tower over the already immense trees of the swamp. The veins of their roots are at times even wide enough for large creatures to traverse, though for the most part the only beings you'll see going through them are smaller races and creatures, particularly those with an affinity for water, as the ecosystem that this labyrinth supports is still very much alive, and many an unsuspecting have been swept away by sudden floods as an Elder Tree quenches it's thirst.
