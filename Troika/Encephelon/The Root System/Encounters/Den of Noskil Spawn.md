# Den of Nosk Spawn
## Description
	Walking through the sprawling root system, you begin to realize that the tunnel before is steadily becoming covered on all sides by spider webs. Thin and silk like at first, though soon they become thick and ropelike, easily capable of entrapping even a dragon, you reckon. The terrain becomes difficult to traverse as your feet begin to stick to the ground with each step, the air becomes earily stale, and begins to smell ever so faintly of death and decomposition.
	The tunnel opens into a large circular chamber roughly 50 feet in diameter and high enough that the ceiling fades into darkness (it is roughly 200 feet), every surface visible is covered in the rope thick webs and much of the surface is covered in what you presume to be both sacs of offspring, and victims of the resisidents of this chamber.
## Encounter
Depending on the approach that the party has coming up to the chamber the following things are possible.
- If the party is approaching loudly, nosk spawn will be aware of their presence and lie in wait
	- Nosk spawn will attempt to drop from above and either web up (**restrained**) or ambush a player (**poisoned**). ===DC 15 perception check to notice===
	- Nosk spawn will attempt to entrap a player in a web spring snare that is set on many of the lower hanging corpses (restrained and 20ft in the air). ===DC 17 Perception Check to notice trap, DC 15 sleight of hand check to not trigger the trap.]=== **If Nosk Spawn are aware of players the trap will be triggered regardless**
- In the event of combat, most of these dens will hold [1D20] spiders, with a total HP pool of 500 HP
	- Weak to Fire
	- Chance to be feared by fire
	- Can attempt to web
		- 1 = slow, 2=restrained
	- Bite attacks, 1d6 to 3d6 piercing damage, with 2d8 poison damage on failed (DC 12 con save) and half as much on a pass
	- Rolling a natural 1 will result in an encounter with Nosk themselves
