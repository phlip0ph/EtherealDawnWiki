# Sunken Corridor
This is just a description for when the players eventually go through a sunken corridor and enter the Sunken Phrontistery

Assuming the use of a repel orb:

	(You) begin to focus on the repel orb. Controlling it's energy and power, and watch as your focus begins settle that the muck infront of you begins to push away from you, in the shape of a semi circle. The air around you goes bone dry, as if once again you find yourself in the middle of The Badlands, though the vile smell of the muck reminds of your placement in the world.
	The muck recedes away from you in time with your steps. The lingering muck that is clinging and pushed against the various surfaces makes clear the intricate channels that run along the walls, floor, and ceiling as it settles into them.
	The corridor continues for some time at a steady decline, the muck receding ahead of you approaching from behind. Eventually the walls and ceiling slope away from you and you stand in a bubble of muck that surrounds on all sides. On the floor you see the edge of triangle painted onto the floor, a bright white that looks freshly painted despite the being buried under the muck of the swamps for, what most likely, was a very long time.
