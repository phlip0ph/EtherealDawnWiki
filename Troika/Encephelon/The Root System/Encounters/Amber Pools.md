# Amber Pools
## Description
	As you walk, you notice the smell of muck and wood steadily being joined by something a little more pleasant, sap. The further you walk the stronger the smell becomes, and eventually you find the source. A long hall, roughly [50 - 100] feet long, [30 - 60] feet wide, and just as tall. The walls are moist with a dark yellow sap that this particular part of the root system seems to secrete. Some sections of the walls appear to be entirely taken over by the sap, large globules of the stuff protruding from the walls, creating pillars of amber. The pattern repeats along the floor, large pools of sap, some having amber only beginning to form along the surface, others entirely solidified. Scattered throughout the room are also a number of tree-like beings (Gnarls) that appear to be tending to process. Some appear to be taking sap, carrying it further down the tunnels through doors made of a strange membrane and writhing roots, others seem to partake in the sap themselves, others still appear to be placing living material into the sap: dying plants, inner trimmings of the root system, and dead or dying creatures.

- Amber Pools are centers of [[Gnarls]]
- [1d10 + 2] entrances/exits for each Amber Pool

## Encounter
If even a single [[Gnarls]] becomes aware of the party, all of the Gnarls present in an Amber Pool will become hostile
- 5 - 10 Gnarls per Amber Pool

## Loot Table
- Elder Sap and Elder Amber, which if consumed will allow one to greater feel the presence of the Root System. A sufficient arcana check (DC 16) on a small amount of sap or amber makes it apparent that the sap has some anti-magic / magic draining properties. Falling into a pool of sap makes this evident and will drain 1 highest level spell slot from a player.
