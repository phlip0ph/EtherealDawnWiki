# Gnarls
Living trees that take care of the Elder Trees and the root system. They seem to hold no intelligence of their own but carry out the will of the swamp and the root system, chasing away outsiders and tending to the root system in various ways. Cleaning, pruning, cleansing, etc. Gnarls never stop growing, when they became unable to fit through the root system that they care for they become apart of it's walls. Outsiders be wary of newly joined Gnarls as they're still very much capable of movement, serving as natural and intelligent traps.
