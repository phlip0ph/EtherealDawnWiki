### [Moldies](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vegepygmy)
Small creatures taking the shapes of various creatures both beast and humanoid. They're not very intelligent and tend to live in small and simplistic villages. They are not inherently hostile and cannot put up much of a fight when threatened. They rely on staying hidden for the most part and are only able to put up a real fight when they come together with shamanistic magic, usually organized by elder Moldies.
