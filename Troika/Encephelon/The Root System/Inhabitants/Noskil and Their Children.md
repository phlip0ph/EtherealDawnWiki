# Noskil The Spider Queen and her children
A giant Orb Weaver that rules over the root system of encephelon. Her network of webs and children means that she knows -at least approximiately- all that is occuring across the entirety of the expansive network. She takes from and kills the inhabitants when she pleases, sacrifices only delaying the inevitable end of whatever small civilization when she sets her many eyes on them. Those who thrive among the root system have either learned to live in symbiosis with her, are irrelevant to her, or are able to hide or defend themselves.
She has many nest across the network, some of them taking up entire Elder Trees.

## Behavoir
Noskil and their children are not active hunters. They do not chase down prey and prefer to avoid direct confrontations unless their numbers are large. Often times they will prefer to either trap prey or stalk and pick off individuals. Those being hunted by Noskil and their children should take great precautions and stay weary of their surroundings.
