Created Thursday 01 April 2021

Tall snowy mountains. Inhabited mostly by creatures such as dragons, rocs, trolls, stone giants, and yetis. Though civilizations of Ararocka, mountain dwarfs, and the like exist. Being such a secluded area it is also a bed of those who exist in exile or wish to experiment in secret. Dragons being the beast they are, there's also good likelyhood of finding legendary artefacts and good loot, if you can survive sneaking into a dragons lair that is. A slice of the elemental plane of ice
