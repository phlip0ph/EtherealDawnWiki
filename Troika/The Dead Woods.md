====== The Dead Woods ======
Created Thursday 01 April 2021

Seemingly a cursed land but quite nice when you get used to it, or have the stomach for it. Animals seem to come here to die, all of the trees are dark and gnarled. Eyes peek from inside holes in the trees. Sometimes the dead wander, just kind of vibin really. Though there are dangers to the living. Trees hungry for flesh, undead awaken violent, and the unpleasantness of it all attracts equally unpleasant folk.
