# Troika 

A strange land, thought by the inhabitants of Mundus to be extremely advanced due to the strange ships they arrived on and goods that they traded. Arrival to the land has not proven such however, the land seems comparable in technlogy and magic to that of Mundus though some of it stranger than usual. Any traces of more advanced civilization are buried or hidden away, if not completely destroyed. 
For a [[Maphic Tower]] Troika has problem with [[Dimensional]] that gets stronger as one gets closer to the center of the continent. As a result of that, the stranger and more warped things get as you get closer to the center of the continent.
