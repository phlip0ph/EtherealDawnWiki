# The Middle
The area that is considered the middle actually encompasses what would be the ring as well. It stretches across the width of Maw Lake that surrounds the skull. A more residential area of Goreane, second only to the Thumb. Mostly homes, local shops and such, though it still gets a fair amount of outsider traffic from those looking to cross The Badlands without facing what lurks on the surface.

## Notable Locations

### Radii Tavern 
- Most popular tavern in the area, posted right in the center. Run by the Bone Devil Sev
