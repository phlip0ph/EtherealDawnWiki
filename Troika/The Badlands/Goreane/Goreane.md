# Goreane

A vast underground network in The Badlands, formed from the bones of gargantuan and yet to be identified creature known by current inhabitants and natives as Goreane. Once a bustling city and now a bustling city again, it has become a hive for criminal activity, the poor and unfortunate, and those with less savoury intentions.  

The harsh conditions of The Badlands and the fact that Goreane is a sprawling underground network that is easy to lose and get lost in, means that the people who go there are often looking to never be found, most of the time they succeed.

There are 5 main entrances into Goreane:
* [[The_Skull]]
* [[The_Thumb]]
* [[The Index]]
* [[The Middle]]
* [[The Pinky]]
The skull is gargantuan, easily comparing to one of the Knives of God, it is also dangerous. In Troika's recorded history, no one has be known to venture into the skull and return. The skull is unexpectantly a strong point of dimensional flux instead of a stable one.

## Problems?

* Occasionally, creatures that burrow through the sand make their way into. Sand Kings and Queens
* Lately, especially in The Middle, creatures have been burrowing through the walls of the more northern areas. Abominations all of them, some say there's fowl magic in work, others believe that the Malphic Tower may be showing signs of inhabitants after 1000 years, others still that 
* The Linia Golem that runs the Linia's Elixirs in the Index is going haywire, essentially becoming it's own person though with some additional conflicts
