# The Pinky 
Along with The Index is one of the more "Touristy" areas of Goreane, due to their relatively close proximity to bordering areas of civilization. There's a light presence of Mythic Dawn followers of the Goreane Sect, they are able to travel here easily from the thumb as they're willing to go through the passages that come with dangerous range of The Skull.

## Notable Locations 
The Bone Flea - a bar near the entrance of the Pinky. Run by Danga, a member of the Mythic Dawn Goreane sect, deformed human. Has a tattoo of the Mythic Dawn symbol thats been stretched out at this point from his deformation.
Simon's Underground - Club. Bar. Tavern. Run by Simon Dew-water
