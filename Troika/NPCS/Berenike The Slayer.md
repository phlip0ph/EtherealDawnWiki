# Berenike The Slayer
A large burly brass dragon born always seems stiff and prepared, is always followed by a suit of armor that contains his patron.
The armor is similarly hulking, and make of a dark, seemingly burnt metal. It walks on it's own, though one wouldn't be able to tell it's empty without opening the helmet or being told. It is capable of speech but often chooses not to. If it does communicate it does so telepathically. The armor violently rips and tears when it morphs.

## Personality
* Short, to the point. Not one for small talk and tries not to get too personal with anyone. He travels alone, he works alone, the only thing he needs is his armor. 
* Hates races that are often aligned/associated with evil, generally distrustful of other magical races.
* Loves a good fight

## Abilities
The armor is capable of morphing into any shape, though the total volume and shape is maintained. It is also incredibly durable.  Berenike will sometimes, wear the armor, wield it, fight alongside it.

## Notes
Native of Troika. Uses his powerful armor to traverse the Land of Troika. He is an effective fighter without his armor but it is his source of power, he would not last long without it.
