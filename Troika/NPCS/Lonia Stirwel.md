# Lonia Stirwel

## General Info
Lonia looks identical to all the other Linia's that manage Linia's Elixirs all across Troika, though she acts quite differently. While the others are cold and calculating business women that are only concerned with the bottom gold piece, Lonia is quite erratic in her behavoir and personality, though none the less intelligent due to it. In fact, her minor levels of insanity may even be a benefit given the right situations.

Unlike the other Linias that, while are mainly concerned with money, stick to the law, Lonia is unconcerned with it. Completely unapposed to providing the locals with drugs and drug paraphenalia as well as doing odd jobs that other Linias would out right refuse.

## Description
A normal half elf woman at a glance, grey eyes, about 5'9".
A short wavy bob hair cut
Upon closer inspection (DC 15 perception or arcana check) you can notice the small and intricate carvings all over her body that mark her as a golemn. Making an advanced check (DC 20 Arcana) you are able to notice even finer details and understand some of the carvings, noticing that a good amount of them appear to be warped, becoming nonsensical to you. It seems that this golemn shouldn't even be functional anymore.
