# Linia Stirwell(s)
Kind and considerate on the surface but she is actually (as well as most of her Golemns) a cold and cunning business woman. Runs the only apothecary/minor magic item chain on Troika, Linia's Elixirs.
Is also incredibly intelligent, discovering a way to split her soul between her golemns to make them more effective, and putting into practice the only useable (though monopolized and expensive) known teleportation chain throughout Troika.

## Notes
Also used teleportation to construct a water and sewage system for [[Encephelon City]], gaining affinity and status.
Constantly deals with Mercane merchants both to resell and for research/personal uses.
