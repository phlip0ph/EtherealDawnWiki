# The Blue Grove
The Woods transitions into the blue grove. A forest that seems straight out of a fantasy book. The fauna and creatures here are even more exotic. Pure white deer with glow blue antlers, mushrooms with eyes, jackalopes, plants that shimmer and glow, fairies, pixies, etc.

## Notable Locations
* [[Alatar's Tower]]
