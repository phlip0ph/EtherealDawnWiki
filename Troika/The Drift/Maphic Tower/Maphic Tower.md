# Maphic Tower 

Towering above all of Troika at the center of the crater that is the drift, sits the Maphic Tower. This tall obsidian black tower is seemingly featureless, it never reflects the light of the sign and disappears into the void of night. No one knows what it exactly it is but many have their theories, stories, and legends

Mafic Tower at the center of The Drift. Is actually a magically iradiated kinetic missle/ship. The ship is from a different time/dimension. A war torn one, where battles span galaxies. This weapon traveled with so much force and magical energy that it ripped a hole through the fabric of universe it originated from. This weapon was intended to be a world ender, tearing straight through the planet. This particular one however, used most of its force tearing through the fabric between dimensions. It still scarred the planet however, the hole it has created goes to the core of the planet. The force merged dimensions on the surface of the planet, giving them enough overlap that beings would not know the difference, their energies infused with eachother. Directly below the missle, dimensions were forcefully torn asunder and recombined in horrible ways.
